## Local Development

The steps required to clone the repo and run a local development server are as follows:
```
git clone https://github.com/playcanvas/super-splat.git
cd super-splat
npm i
npm run develop
```

The last command `npm run develop` will build and run a local version of the editor on port 3000. Changes to the source are detected and the editor is automatically rebuilt.

To access the local editor instance, open a browser tab and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
